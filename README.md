Yole is a cross-platform text editor with Android as the primary production platform.
This project aims to make an editor that is versatile, flexible, and lightweight.
Yole utilizes simple markup formats like Markdown and todo.txt for note-taking and list management.
It is versatile at working with text; it can also be used for keeping bookmarks, copying to clipboard, fast opening a link from text and lots more.
Created files are interoperable with any other plaintext software on any platform.
Yole is openly developed free software that accepts community contributions.

![Line numbers](doc/assets/2023-10-11-line-numbers.webp)

### New format: AsciiDoc
AsciiDoc is one of the new formats that are now supported.
While it might be not as much fleshed out like Markdown, it should fit for general use.

![AsciiDoc](doc/assets/2023-10-11-asciidoc.webp)

### New format: CSV
[CSV file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) are supported now (in sense of syntax highlighting and preview). 
For details see [CSV README](doc/2023-06-02-csv-readme.md), it was implemented in #1988, #1987, #1980, #1667.

* Editor with SyntaxHighlighter
* Each csv column is shown in a different unique color to see which csv-data belongs to which colum/header
* Preview as html-Table with export as pdf
* A csv column may contain markdown (See Example column in screenshot)

![](doc/assets/csv/2023-06-25-csv-landscape.webp)

### New format: Org-Mode
The third and last new format newly added is Org-Mode. Note that currently only editor syntax highlighting and action buttons to make editing easier are available.
There is no dedicated view mode implemented.

# FAQ

## File browser & file management

#### How do I save a file?
Yole automatically saves text when you leave Yole or close a file. Additionally there is save button in the top menu.

#### How do I save files to SD Cards?
Browse to the start folder of your SD Card and press the + button (using file browser or the menu option). Now press the plus button and follow the steps in the dialog. Afterwards Yole's file browser won't strike out filenames anymore and files are writable.

![sdcard-mount](doc/assets/2019-05-06-sdcard-mount.webp)

#### How to synchronize files?
Yole is and will stay an offline focused application. It works with sync synchronization apps, they have to do syncing respectively.
Sync clients known to work in combination include BitTorrent Sync, Dropbox, FolderSync, OwnCloud, NextCloud, Seafile, Syncthing, Syncopoli and others.  
The project recommendation is Syncthing. [-> Guide for Syncthing](doc/2020-04-04-syncthing-file-sync-setup-how-to-use-with-markor.md)

#### What is Notebook?
The root folder of your files! Yole starts with this folder at the main screen and allows you to browse files. You can work at any (accessible) file & location with Yole.

#### What is ToDo?
Your main to-do list file in todo.txt format. You can access it by swiping once at the main screen, by selecting todo.txt at Notebook, or by using the dedicated launcher. You can also open it from Notebook or other apps! You will also have the option to create a to-do task when sharing text into Yole when the text is just one line. The location of this file is freely choosable and independent from the Notebook directory.

#### What is QuickNote?
The fastest and easiest way to take notes! QuickNote is a file in Markdown format with a freely choosable file location. You can access it by swiping twice at the main screen, by selecting QuickNote at Notebook, or by using the dedicated launcher. The location of this file is freely choosable and independent from the Notebook directory.

#### How can I encrypt my notes?
You have to set a master password in Settings/General/File encryption password and toggle "Encrypt file content" when you create a note that you want encrypted.
If you want to use a different password for a different file you will have to change the master password before you create that file.
Yole remembers locally only the last used password and automatically decrypts only the content of the files that use the most recent password, if you don't want markor to automatically decrypt any file you can set the master password to some random string. 

#### Launchers
A launcher is a "start menu option" in your devices launcher (=appdrawer / start menu). When Yole is installed you have the start menu option for Yole. When the Yole settings option "Launcher (Special Documents)" is enabled, you get the additional start menu options for ToDo and QuickNote. Note that a device restart is required when you change this option.

## Format: Markdown
#### What is Markdown?
A general purpose markup format for documents of all kinds. As Markdown gets converted to HTML prior displaying a rendered view, you can also include HTML in the text, thus you can do everything web browsers can do.

CommonMark is the specification that the markdown parser used in Yole implements.

#### Links to files that contains spaces
Most Markdown applications use URL encoding for links, so does Yole. This means replace every space` ` with `%20`. This ensures that your Markdown content is compatible with most other Markdown applications.<br/><br/>

Yole has a dedicated button for adding links and file references, which automatically applies this appropiate format.  Take a look at this [video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6735650/63089879-e6aa9400-bf48-11e9-87c1-78a1ba1c444f.gif) to find out where the file reference button is located and how to use it.<br/><br/>

Example: `[alt](my cool file.md)` ⮕ `[alt](my%20cool%20file.md)`.

#### Can I use Yole in class to write down equations? (Math)
Yes, Yole has advanced functionalities for math! Enable the feature by checking Settings»Format»Markdown»Math.<br/><br/>

Yole's [markdown-reference.md](samples/markor-markdown-reference.md) template (available from new file dialog) showcases some examples.  
Learn more about available functions and symbols here: [1](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html), [2](https://katex.org/docs/support_table.html)


## Format: todo.txt
#### What is todo.txt?
Todo.txt is a simple text format for todo. Each line of text is a task. The idea comes from [Gina Trapani](https://github.com/ginatrapani).

#### How to mark a task done?
Done tasks are marked by a `x ` in begining of the line and can optionally be moved to a done/archive file.

#### What is a context (@)?
  With contexts you can mark a situation or place. You may use it to categorize your todos. Context is part of todo.txt format, add `@` in front of a word to create one.  
  Examples: @home @work

#### What is a project (+)?
  With projects you can group tasks by a specific project. You may use it to tag your todos with recognizable meta information. Context is part of todo.txt format, add `+` in front of a word to create one.  
  Examples: +video +download +holidayPlanning
